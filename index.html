<center><b><font color="#FFFFFF"><font size=+3>holy shit I made this on
OS/2 Warp 4</font></font></b>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">This was hell to setup. Very not fun. But I did
it damn it!</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Here I even have proof!</font>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF">OS/2 is actually pretty interesting. Being a non
windows OS that actually runs most windows apps!</font><font color="#FFFFFF"></font>
<p><img SRC="WINWARP.JPG" height=600 width=800>
<br><font color="#FFFFFF">That's pretty cool!</font><font color="#FFFFFF"></font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>Now actually getting this setup was a chore
in and of itself.</b> MAKE SURE YOU USE 4.52 OR ELSE EVERYTHING WILL GO
WRONG.</font>
<br><font color="#FFFFFF">Also use VirtualBox for best results. I had a
ton of issues trying to get it to boot under UTM. Constant crashes and
issues. But hey! Once you get it all setup. It works fine from there. You
can't really do much in this old OS though. It's fun to poke around at
it though.</font><font color="#FFFFFF"></font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Anyways that's really it for OS/2 Warp 4. If I
have anymore I want to add about this I'll update the page!</font></center>
